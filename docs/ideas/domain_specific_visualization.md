# Domain-Specific model visualization

Currently, both meta-models and models can be visualized but the model
visualization is not domain-specific. It would be nice to have a way do specify
what our language looks like (see [StateMachine
example](https://github.com/igordejanovic/textX/tree/master/examples/StateMachine)).
Some form of DSL for specifying the graphical syntax could help.

Besides, graphical syntaxes are very good for the structure overview and navigation
(panning, zooming). This feature would provide fast navigation over the model and
could be synced with the textual representation in various editors (vim, emacs,
atom, sublime...) using editor plugins.

Therefore, editing would be done textually, but code comprehension and
navigation could be aided by graphical visualization.
