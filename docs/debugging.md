# Debugging

textX supports debugging on the meta-model (grammar) and model levels. If
debugging is enabled, textX will print various debugging messages.

If the `debug` parameter of the meta-model construction is set to `True`, debug messages
during grammar parsing and meta-model construction will be printed. Additionally,
a parse tree created during the grammar parsing as well as meta-model (if constructed
successfully) dot files will be generated:

```python
form textx.metamodel import metamodel_from_file

robot_metamodel = metamodel_from_file('robot.tx', debug=True)
```

If `debug` is set in the `model_from_file/str` calls, various
messages during the modelk6 parsing and construction will be printed. Additionally,
parse tree created from the input as well as the model will be exported to dot
files.

```python
  robot_program = robot_metamodel.model_from_file('program.rbt', debug=True)
```

Alternatively, you can use [textx check or visualize command](textx_command.md)
in debug mode.

    $ textx -d visualize robot.tx program.rbt

    Generating 'robot.tx.dot' file for meta-model.
    To convert to png run 'dot -Tpng -O robot.tx.dot'
    Generating 'program.rbt.dot' file for model.
    To convert to png run 'dot -Tpng -O program.rbt.dot'

This command renders parse trees and parser models of both textX and your
language to dot files. Also, a meta-model and model of the language will be
rendered if parsed correctly.
