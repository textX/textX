# Error handling

textX will raise an error if a syntax or semantic error is detected during
meta-model or model parsing/construction.

For a syntax error `TextXSyntaxError` is raised. For a semantic error
`TextXSemanticError` is raised. Both exceptions inherit from `TextXError`.
These exceptions are located in `textx.exceptions` module.

All exceptions have `message` attribute with the error message and `line` and
`col` attributes, which show the line and column where the error was found.


!!! note
    See also [textx command/tool](textx_command.md) for (meta)model checking 
    from command line.
