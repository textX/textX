# Contributing

textX is open for contributions. You can contribute code, documentation, tests,
bug reports.  If you plan to make a contribution it would be great if you first
announce that on the discussion forum.

For bug reports please use [github issue
tracker](https://github.com/igordejanovic/textx/issues/).

For code/doc/test contributions do the following:

1. Fork the [project on github](https://github.com/igordejanovic/textx/).
1. Clone your fork.
1. Make a branch for the new feature and switch to it.
1. Make one or more commits.
1. Push your branch to github.
1. Make a pull request. I will look at the changes and if everything is ok I will pull it in.

!!! note
    For code contributions please try to adhere to the [PEP-8
    guidelines](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).  Although I am not
    strict in that regard it is useful to have a common ground for coding style.
    To make things easier use tools for code checking (PyLint, PyFlakes, pep8
    etc.).
