# Hello World example

This is an example of a very simple Hello World like language.

---


These are the steps to build a very basic Hello World - like language.

1. Write a language description in textX (file `hello.tx`):

        HelloWorldModel:
          'hello' to_greet+=Who[',']
        ;

        Who:
          name = /[^,]*/
        ;

    Description consists of a set of parsing rules which at the same time
    describe Python classes that will be dynamically created and used to
    instantiate objects of your model.  This small example consists of two
    rules: `HelloWorldModel` and `Who`.  `HelloWorldModel` starts with the
    keyword `hello` after which one or more `Who` objects must be written
    and separated with commas. `Who` objects will be parsed, instantiated and stored
    in a `to_greet` list on a `HelloWorldModel` object. `Who` objects consist
    only of their names which must match the regular expression rule
    `/[^,]*/` (match non-comma zero or more times). Please see [textX
    grammar](../grammar.md) section for more information on writing grammar rules.

2. Create the meta-model from textX language description (file `hello.py`):

        from textx.metamodel import metamodel_from_file
        hello_meta = metamodel_from_file('hello.tx')


3. Optionally export the meta-model to dot (visualize your language's abstract syntax):

        from textx.export import metamodel_export
        metamodel_export(hello_meta, 'hello_meta.dot')

    ![hello meta-model](../images/hello_meta.dot.png)

    You can see that for each rule from the language description an appropriate
    Python class was created. A BASETYPE hierarchy is built-in. Each
    meta-model has it.

4. Create some content (i.e. model) in your new language (``example.hello``):

        hello World, Solar System, Universe

    Your language syntax is also described by the language rules from step 1.

    If we break down the text of the example model it looks like this:

    ![hello model parts](../images/hello_parts.png)

    We see that the whole line is a `HelloWorldModel` and the parts `World`, 
    `Solar System`, and `Universe` are `Who` objects. Red coloured text is
    syntactic noise that is needed by the parser (and programmers) to recognize
    the boundaries of the objects in the text.

5. Use meta-model to create models from a textual description:


        example_hello_model = hello_meta.model_from_file('example.hello')



    Textual model ‘example.hello’ will be parsed and transformed to a plain
    Python object graph. Object classes are those defined by the meta-model.

6. You can optionally export the model to `dot` file to visualize it:

        from textx.export import model_export
        model_export(example_hello_model, 'example.dot')

    ![Example hello model](../images/example.dot.png)

    This is an object graph automatically constructed from `example.hello`
    file.

    We see that each `Who` object is contained in the python attribute
    `to_greet` of list type which is defined by the grammar.


7. Use your model: interpret it, generate code … It is a plain Python
   graph of objects with plain attributes!
