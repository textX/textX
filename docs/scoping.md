# textX Scoping

## Motivation and Introduction to Scoping

Assume a grammar with references as in the following example (grammar snippet).

    MyAttribute:
            ref=[MyInterface|FQN] name=ID ';'
    ;

The scope provider is responsible for the reference resolution of such a reference.

The default behavior (default scope provider) is looking for the referenced name globally.
Other scope providers will take namespaces into account, support references to parts of
the model stored in different files or even models defined by other metamodels
(imported into the current metamodel). Moreover, scope providers exist allowing to reference
model elements relative to other referenced model elements: This can be a referenced method
defined in a referenced class of an instance (with a metamodel defining classes, methods
and instances of classes).


## Usage

The scope providers are registered to the metamodel and can be bound to specific parts of rules:

 * e.g., my_meta_model.register_scope_providers({"\*.\*":         scoping.providers.FQN()})
 * or: my_meta_model.register_scope_providers({"MyAttribute.ref": scoping.providers.FQN()})
 * or: my_meta_model.register_scope_providers({"\*.ref":          scoping.providers.FQN()})
 * or: my_meta_model.register_scope_providers({"MyAttribute.*":   scoping.providers.FQN()})

Example (from tests/test_scoping/test_local_scope.py):

    # Grammar snippet (Components.tx)
    Component:
        'component' name=ID ('extends' extends+=[Component|FQN][','])? '{'
            slots*=Slot
        '}'
    ;
    Slot: SlotIn|SlotOut;
    # ...
    Instance:
        'instance' name=ID ':' component=[Component|FQN] ;
    Connection:
        'connect'
          from_inst=[Instance|ID] '.' from_port=[SlotOut|ID]
        'to'
          to_inst=[Instance|ID] '.' to_port=[SlotIn|ID]
    ;

    # Python snippet
    my_meta_model = metamodel_from_file(abspath(dirname(__file__)) + '/components_model1/Components.tx')
    my_meta_model.register_scope_providers({
        "*.*": scoping_providers.FQN(),
        "Connection.from_port": scoping_providers.RelativeName("from_inst.component.slots"),
        "Connection.to_port": scoping_providers.RelativeName("to_inst.component.slots"),
    })


This example selects the fully qualified name provider
as default provider ("\*.\*"). Moreover, for special attributes of
a "Connection" a relative name lookup is specified: Here the "path" from the
rule "Connection" containing the attribute of interest
(e.g. "Connection.from_port") to the referenced element is specified
(the slot contained in "from_inst.component.slots").
Since this attribute is a list, the list is searched to find
the referenced name.

!!! note
    Special rule selections (e.g., "Connection.from_port") are preferred
    to wildcard selection (e.e, "\*.\*").

### Scope Providers defined in Module "textx.scoping.providers"

We provide some standard scope providers:

 * textx.scoping.providers.PlainName: This is the **default provider** of
   textX.
 * textx.scoping.providers.FQN: This is a **provider similar to Java or Xtext
   name loopup**.
   Example: see tests/test_scoping/test_full_qualified_name.py.
 * textx.scoping.providers.ImportURI: This a provider which **allows to load
   additional modules** for lookup.
   You need to define a rule with an attribute "importURI" as string (like in
   Xtext). This string is then used to load other models. Moreover, you need
   to provide another scope provider to manage the concrete lookup, e.g., the
   scope_provider_plain_names or the scope_provider_fully_qualified_names.
   Example: see tests/test_scoping/test_import_module.py.
    - FQNImportURI (decorated scope provider)
    - PlainNameImportURI (decorated scope provider)
 * textx.scoping.providers.GlobalRepo: This is a provider where **you initially
   need to specifiy the model files to be loaded and used for lookup**. Like
   for ImportURI you need to provide another scope provider for the constere
   loopup.
   Example: see tests/test_scoping/test_global_import_modules.py.
    - textx.scoping.providers.FQNGlobalRepo (decorated scope provider)
    - textx.scoping.providers.PlainNameGlobalRepo (decorated scope provider)
 * textx.scoping.providers.RelativeName: This is a scope provider to **resolve
   relative lookups**: e.g., model-methods of a model-instance, defined by the
   class associated with the model-instance. Typically, another reference (the
   reference to the model-class of a model-instance) is used to determine the
   concrete referenced object (e.g. the model-method, owned by a model-class).
   Example: see tests/test_scoping/test_local_scope.py.
 * textx.scoping.providers.ExtRelativeName: The same as RelativeName **allowing
   to model inheritance or chained lookups**.
   Example: see tests/test_scoping/test_local_scope.py.


### Note on Uniqueness of Model Elements

Two different models created using one single meta model (not using a scope
provider like GlobalRepo, but by directly loading the models from file) have
different instances of the same model elements. If you need two such models to
share their model element instances, you can specify this, while creating the
meta model (global_repository=True). Then, the meta model will store an own
instance of a GlobalModelRepository as a base for all loaded models.

Model elements in models including other parts of the model (possibly
circular) have unique model elements (no double instances).

Examples see tests/test_scoping/test_import_module.py.


### Combining Metamodels

In addition, there is also global data stored in the class
"textx.scoping.MetaModelProvider": Here, you can register meta models
associated to files patterns. Thus, you can control which meta model to use
when loading a file in a scope provider using the "ImportURI"-feature (e.g.,
FQNImportURI). If no file pattern matches, the meta model of the current model
is utilized.

Examples see tests/test_scoping/test_metamodel_provider.py.


## Technical aspects and implementation details

The scope providers are python callables accepting parser,obj,attr,obj_ref:

 * parser  : the current parser
 * obj     : the object representing the start of the search (e.g., a rule
             (e.g. "MyAttribute" in the example above, or the model)
 * attr    : a reference to the attribute "ref"
 * obj_ref : a textx.model.ObjCrossRef - the reference to be resolved

The scope provides return the referenced object (e.g. a "MyInterface" object
in the example illustrated in the "Motivation and Introduction" above (or None
if nothing is found; or a Postponed object, see below).

Scope providers shall be stateless or have unmodifiable state after
construction: this means they should allow to be reused for different models
(created using the same meta model) without interacting with each other.
This means, they must save their state in the corresponding model, if they
need to store data (e.g., if they load additional models from files *during
name resolution*, they are not allowed to store them inside the scope
provider.

!!! note
    Scope providers as normal functions (def <name>(...):..., not
    accessing global data, are safe per se. The reason to be stateless, is that
    no side effects (beside, e.g., loading other models) should incluence the
    name lookup.

The state of model resolution should mainly consist of models already loaded.
These models are stored in a GlobalModelRepository class. This class (if
required) is stored in the model. An included model loaded from another
including model "inherits" the part of the GlobalModelRepository representing
all loaded models. This is done to (a) cache already loaded models and (b)
guarantee, that every referenced model element is instantiated exactly once.
Even in the case of circular inclusions.

Scope providers may return an object of type Postponed, if they depend on
another event to happen first. This event is typically the resolution of
another reference. The resolution process will repeat multiple times over
all unresolved references to be resolved until all references are resolved or
no progress regarding the resolution is observed. In the latter case an error
is raised. The control flow responsability of the resolution process is
allocated to the model.py module.
