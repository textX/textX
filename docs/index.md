[textX](https://github.com/igordejanovic/textX) is a meta-language (i.e. a
language for language definition) for domain-specific language (DSL)
specification in Python.

In a nutshell, textX will help you build your textual language in an easy way.
You can invent your own language or build a support for an already existing
textual language or file format.

From a single grammar description textX automatically builds a meta-model (in
the form of Python classes) and a parser for your language. Parser will parse
expressions of your language and automatically build a graph of Python objects
(i.e. the model) corresponding to the meta-model.

textX is inspired by [Xtext](http://www.eclipse.org/xtext/) - a Java based
language workbench for building DSLs with full tooling support (editors,
debuggers etc.) on the Eclipse platform.  If you like Java and
[Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) check it out. It is a great tool.

A video tutorial for textX installation and implementation of a simple data modeling
language is bellow.

## Feature highlights

* **Meta-model/parser from a single description**

    A single description is used to define both language concrete syntax and its
    meta-model (a.k.a. abstract syntax). See the description of
    [grammar](grammar.md) and [metamodel](metamodel.md).

* **Automatic model (AST) construction**

    Parse tree will automatically be transformed to a graph of python objects
    (a.k.a. the model). See the [model](model.md) section.

    Python classes will be created by textX but, if needed, user supplied
    classes may be used. See [custom classes](metamodel.md#custom-classes).

* **Automatic linking**

    You can have references to other objects in your language and the textual
    representation of the reference will be resolved to the proper python reference
    automatically.

* **Automatic parent-child relationships**

    textX will maintain a parent-child relationships imposed by the grammar.
    See [parent-child relationships](metamodel.md#parent-child-relationships).

* **Parser control**

    Parser can be configured with regard to case handling, whitespace handling,
    keyword handling etc. See [parser
    configuration](metamodel.md#parser-configuration).


* **Model/object post-processing**

    A callbacks (so called processors) can be registered for models and
    individual classes.  This enables model/object postprocessing (validation,
    additional changes etc.).  See [processors](metamodel.md#processors) section.


* **Grammar modularization - imports**

    Grammar can be split into multiple files and then files/grammars can be
    imported where needed. See [Grammar
    modularization](grammar.md#grammar-modularization).


* **Meta-model/model visualization**

    Both meta-model and parsed models can be visulized using
    [GraphViz](http://graphviz.org/) software package. See
    [visualization](visualization.md) section.


## Installation

    $ pip install textX

Note: Previous command requires [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to be
installed.

To verify that textX is properly installed run:

    $ textx

You should get output like this:

    error: the following arguments are required: cmd, metamodel
    usage: textx [-h] [-i] [-d] cmd metamodel [model]

    textX checker and visualizer

    ...

* Commercial

    - textX is used as a part of [Typhoon-HIL's](https://www.typhoon-hil.com/?utm_campaign=1604_HIL402%20Campaign&utm_content=Igor_github&utm_source=email)
      schematic editor for the description of power electronic and DSP schemes and
      components.
